# NER.BERT-BiLSTM-CRF
 
A basic BERT-BiLSTM-CRF Model using in NER problem.

The code is modified from [abhishekkrthakur/bert-entity-extraction](https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/bert-entity-extraction) repository that only uses BERT model to attack the same problem and dataset.
The dataset is in kaggle followed by [link](https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavwalia95/entity-annotated-corpus).
